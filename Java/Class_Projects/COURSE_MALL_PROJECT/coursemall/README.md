Once upon a time, in a world brimming with knowledge, there was a magical marketplace called 'Course Mall'. This wasn't just any marketplace; it was a special web-based bazaar where the thirst for learning met the perfect course. Imagine a place where you could find a collection of the finest, most diverse, and specially selected courses from around the world, all under one roof.

## Who is it for?

Whether you're an aspiring artist, a budding scientist, or a curious historian, Course Mall was the place to be. 

## How does it work?

All you needed to do was whisper your interest into the search bar, be it a category, a subcategory, or even the name of your favorite author. As if by magic, the Course Mall would present you with a carefully curated list of the best courses tailored just for you. Each course, neatly laid out in a table with its name, the author, and a link to the course, was just a click away.
